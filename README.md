# Uber Website Clone

An Uber website clone project made with HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and flexbox by recreating a website by site and only using google/stack overflow to improve our research and problem solving skills. 

I learned a lot from this project. I documented some learning outcomes in the CSS file. I would like to come back to this when I have time and refactor the CSS.
